/*
Usage:

Quick-configure:
1. Use the pre-placed objects destroy_obj1 and/or destroy_obj2
2. Move the objective(s) to where you want them
3. If you only want 1 objective, only move destroy_obj1 and set the first value in the _obj2 arrray above to objNull or delete destroy_obj2 and its marker in editor

Custom:
1. Create at least one object in the editor that can be destroyed, give the object a variable name (double-click, at the top)
2. Create a marker for the objective you created in step 1. ***The marker HAS to be an AREA MARKER***

There is a maximum of 3 objectives, minimum of 1
