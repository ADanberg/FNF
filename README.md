# Mission files for FNF

Note: If this is your first mission, or one of your first, it is recommended that you keep the mission fairly simple (light assets, uncomplicated terrain, daytime, etc.) until you get a good feel for how players tend to play the missions at FNF.

Steps:

1. Configure "config.hpp" in the root mission directory and the respective file for your chosen game mode in the "mode_config" directory.
2. Move the objectives to your wanted locations.
3. Move your wanted sides to their starting location and configure their start zone marker.
4. Delete any unwanted sides and their start zone marker.
5. Place any vehicle assets.
6. Configure mission start time, weather, etc.
7. Configure the play boundary trigger (zoneTrigger).
8. Export mission to MP to create a mission .pbo and send that file over to FNF Staff.

-To give a unit the key for a vehicle, sync that unit to the chosen vehicle. This is required for helicopters, planes, tracked APCs, wheeled APCs and tanks.
